# Reimbursement {#reimburse}

By default, we make reimbursement for processed operations to merchants once every two days when 10,000 rubles reached. If you need a custom schedule for reimbursements, contact your personal support manager.

QIWI holds a commission for each confirmed operation. If operation is cancelled before the confirmation, commission will not hold.  If partial refund is made before the confirmation, commission will be recalculated.
