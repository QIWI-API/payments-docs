# Payment Through Merchant Web Form {#merchant-api-integration}

<aside class="warning">
When you integrate with your payment form, you send requests to the API with full card numbers and CVV/CVV2 code. This is only allowed if your organization has a PCI DSS certificate. 

PCI DSS is an information security standard adopted in the Visa and MasterCard payment card industry. All companies that accept cards are required to comply with the requirements of the standard.
</aside>

When you intergrate payments through your own payment form, [Bank Card](#qiwi-form-card) payment method is available by default. The following payment methods are connected on demand:

* [Card and QIWI Wallet payment token](#merchant-token-pay).
* [Apple Pay](#merchant-form-applepay).
* [Google Pay](#merchant-form-googlepay).
* [Faster Payments System](#merchant-form-sbp).

To create a payment, send the following data in API request [Payment](#payments):

* API access key;
* amount of payment;
* payment method;
* other information for payment creation.


## Bank Card {#merchant-form-card}

The payment protocol supports both a two-step payment with holding funds on the customer's card, and a one-step payment without the authentication of the customer.

### Payment creation {#merchant-form-hold}

To start payment with subsequent hold of funds on the customer card (two-step payment), send the following data in API  request [Payment](#payments):

* API access key;
* amount of the payment;
* payment method `CARD` and customer's card data;
* other data for the payment.

For the two-step payment, the [reimbursement](#reimburse) is formed only after the [order confirmation](#merchant-capture).

<aside class="notice">
By default, when holding funds, the service expects <a href="#merchant-capture">confirmation of the payment</a> within 72 hours. At the end of the term, the payment is self-confirmed. To increase or reduce the waiting period, or to set up a payment autoreversal, contact Support. The waiting period may not last more than 5 days. 
</aside>

For payment without the customer's authentication (one-step payment), include in the API request [Invoice](#invoice_put) the `"flags":["SALE"]` parameter. If you do not pass this parameter, the unconditional holding of funds for the payment will be made.

}
~~~

If bank requires 3DS authentication of the customer, you will need to pass additional authentication from the issuer. In this case, the payment request adds `requirements.threeDS` JSON-object with fields:

- `acsUrl` — 3-D Secure authentication server URL to redirect to the issuer's confirmation page;
- `pareq` — an encrypted 3-D Secure authentication request.

To get the `PaReS` result of authentication, make a POST query to the 3-D Secure authentication server URL with parameters:

- `TermUrl` — customer redirection URL after successful 3-D Secure authentication;
- `MD` — a unique transaction identifier;
- `PaReq` — the `pareq` value from the response to the payment request.

To maintain backward compatibility, using 3-D Secure 1.0 or 3-D Secure 2.0 does not affect your integration with the API. 

The customer's information is passed to the card payment system. The issuer bank either grants permission to charge funds without authentication (frictionless flow) or decides whether to authenticate with a single-time password (challenge flow). After the authorization is passed, the customer is redirected to `TermUrl` URL with the encrypted result of the authentication in the `PaRes` parameter.

To complete the authentication of the customer, pass on the API request [Completing authentication](#payment_complete):

* unique RSP ID;
* payment number (`paymentId` option) from the response to the payment request;
* 3-D Secure verification value (`PaRes` value)

### Confirm payment {#merchant-capture}

The capture step is required only for two-step payments with holding funds.

To confirm payment:

* Get `paymentId` of the payment:
     * From [notification](#payment_callback) after successful holding funds.
     * From the response to [Payment status](#payment_get) API request.
* Send API request [Confirm payment](#capture) with received `paymentId` value.

  },
  "customer": {
        "account": "token324"
  }
}
~~~

The payment tokens are used for charging a customer balance without entering card details or QIWI Wallet number. By default, the use of payment tokens is disabled. Contact your Support manager to enable that.

The issue of a payment token is described [in this section](#payment-token-issue).

<aside class="warning">
Customer will be able to make payment by payment token only on the site where payment token was issued.

To make the payment token valid on other sites, send a request to Support.
</aside>

To pay for the customer order with its payment token, send in API request [Payment](#payments) the following data:

* the payment token in `paymentMethod` JSON-object,
* customer identifier for which the payment token was issued, in `customer.account` parameter.

Parameter|Type|Description
--------|---|--------
paymentMethod.type|String|Type of the operation. Only `TOKEN`
paymentMethod.paymentToken|String| Payment token string
customer.account|String|Unique ID of the customer in the RSP system for which the payment token was issued. **Without this parameter, you cannot pay with the payment token.**

Customer won't have to enter its card data and proceed with 3-D Secure authentication.

## Apple Pay {#merchant-form-applepay}

pple Pay purchases are made without card data entering. The technology works in mobile apps and the Safari browser on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and MacBook.

To add Apple Pay payment method to the Merchant Payment Form, contact your Support manager.

You need to integrate Merchant Payment form with Apple  before starting accept Apple Pay payments. This is required to verify the RSP web-site and receive the customer's payment data. RSP requirements for integrating Apple Pay on the web page:

* Developer account in Apple Developer Program.
* Using HTTPS on the Apple Pay page, TLS 1.2 support, valid SSL certificate.
* Compliance with [Apple's guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/acceptable-use-guidelines-for-websites/) on using Apple Pay on web-sites.
* Using the [Apple Pay JS API framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api).

Visit [Apple's website](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/implementation/) to get more information on integration.

### Payment process {#merchant-form-applepay-steps}

The process of making an Apple Pay payment in the API consists of five steps:

1. Creating an Apple Pay Payment Session.
2. Validating RSP in Apple Pay.
3. Getting encrypted payment data from Apple Pay.
4. Deciphering payment data on the RSP side (optional).
5. Sending a [request for charging](#payments) to QIWI:
     - with encrypted data;
     - with decrypted data, when Apple payment token is decrypted in the merchant's side.

### How to send a payment with encrypted data {#merchant-form-applepay-encrypt}

To send payment data to QIWI, it is necessary to specify the `paymentMethod.type=APPLE _PAY_TOKEN` in the API [Payment request](#payments) body.

  }
}
~~~

Specify the following parameters in the `paymentMethod` JSON-object:

* `type` — payment method type, `APPLE_PAY_TOKEN` only;
* `paymentData` — JSON-object with Apple Pay payment token data (required). It is taken from `paymentData` field of the Apple Pay payment token (see [JSON-structure description](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PaymentTokenJSON/PaymentTokenJSON.html)):
	* `version` — payment token version, might be `EC_v1` or `RSA_v1` (required);
	* `data` — encrypted payment data as base64 string (required);
	* `header` — JSON-object with additional information used for decryption and verification of the payment (required):
	  * `applicationData` — SHA-256 hash of the `applicationData` field of the original payment token as HEX-string (required);
	  * `ephemeralPublicKey` — bytes array of ephemeral public key encoded as Base64-string (only with `version=EC_v1`);
	  * `wrappedKey` — symmetrical key based on public RSA-key encoded as Base64-string (only with  `version=RSA_v1`);
	  * `publicKeyHash` — SHA-256 hash from bytes array of the merchant's certificate public key, Base64-string (required);
	  * `transactionId` — transaction identifier generated on the device where the payment is initiated. HEX-identifier taken as a string (required);
	* `signature` — signature computed from the payment token, Base64-string (required).

~~~

Use this method when Apple Pay payment token is decrypted on your side.

To provide payment data to QIWI, send in API request [Payment](#payments) `paymentMethod` JSON-object containing fields:

* `"type": "CARD"`;
* data from decrypted APple Pay token:
   * PAN in `"pan"` field;
   * expiration date in `MM/YY` format in `"expiryDate"` field;
* `external3dSec` JSON-object containing 3-D Secure data from Apple:
   * `type` — `APPLE_PAY` always;
   * `onlinePaymentCryptogram` — content of `onlinePaymentCryptogram` field from the decrypted Apple Pay payment token (Base64-encoded string);
   * `eci` — ECI indicator. It must be transmitted if the `eciIndicator` field is received in Apple Pay payment token. Otherwise, don't pass the option.

## Google Pay {#merchant-form-googlepay}

Payments from Visa and MasterCard payment cards are supported for Google Pay™ method. Google Pay™ method integration into merchant's Payment Form consists of the following steps:

1. Implement the requirements of [Google Pay™ WEB](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web) for accepting encrypted payment data. Check [Integration checklist for Google Pay™ integration on web-sites](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist) and [Google Pay™ brand guidelines for web-sites](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/brand-guidelines).
2. To integrate, you need to comply with the data sending requirements:
  - [with encrypted data](#merchant-form-googlepay-encrypted),
  - [with decrypted data](#merchant-form-googlepay-decrypted).
3. [Request production access](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/request-prod-access). Indicate the following data in the request:
    * Tokenization Method — Gateway;
    * Payment Processor or Gateway — `qiwi`;
    * Merchant Name — you need to get it from QIWI Support.
4. Google will test your Payment Form in production environment and approve the launch.

token = 'Hello world'

token_bytes = token.encode('utf-8')
token_deflated = zlib.compress(token_bytes)
token_base64 = base64.b64encode(token_deflated)

resp_token = resp_bytes.decode('utf-8')

print('resp_token: ', resp_token)
~~~

~~~shell
>> resp_token: 'Hello world'
~~~

To send payment data to QIWI, send the following parameters in API request [Payment](#payments) in JSON-object `paymentMethod`:

* `paymentMethod.type=GOOGLE_PAY_TOKEN`
* `paymentMethod.paymentToken`. The field value is calculated by the following algorithm:

   `b64_encode_bytes_to_string (compress_bytes_with_zlib (to_bytes (JSON)))`

  Step 1 (`to_bytes`) — Convert JSON-object to bytes array UTF-8 encoded. **Structure of the JSON-object described in [Google payment data cryptography guide](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/resources/payment-data-cryptography)**.

  Step 2 (`compress_bytes_with_zlib`) — Compress the bytes from Step 1 by zlib library. You should follow the specification [RFC1950](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt) and provide `zlib header` record into the beginning of compressed data pipe.

  Step 3 (`b64_encode_bytes_to_string`) — Apply Base64-encoding to the bytes from Step 2.

As a result of these Steps, you obtain an encoded string which is the `paymentToken` field value.

## Faster Payments System {#merchant-form-sbp}

**Payment protocol** supports charging funds from the customer by [Faster Payments System](https://sbp.nspk.ru/) (SBP). With SBP, payment can be made to commercial organizations, including QR-coded ones.

By default, SBP payment method is turned off. To use this method, contact your Support manager.

~~~

In order for the customer to make a payment through the SBP, release the ЙR-code. To do this, in the API request [Payment](#payments) include the `SBP` payment method:

`"paymentMethod" : { "type": "SBP" }`

To add a payment description, use the `comment` field in the request. If the field in the request is empty, the customer's bank app will show the name of your service as registered in QIWI.

In the response to the request, the JSON object `requirements.sbp` contains the data of the QR-code:

* `image.content` — base64-encoded QR-code. After decryption, you get an image to show to the customer.
* `payload` — URL-based QR for customer redirection to its bank app.

The QR-code is active for 72 hours and is deactivated after the period ends.
