# Payment Through Merchant Web Form {#merchant-api-integration}

<aside class="warning">
When you integrate with your payment form, you send requests to the API with full card numbers and CVV/CVV2 code. This is only allowed if your organization has a PCI DSS certificate.

PCI DSS is an information security standard adopted in the Visa and MasterCard payment card industry. All companies that accept cards are required to comply with the requirements of the standard.
</aside>

When you integrate payments with your own payment form, [Bank Card](#qiwi-form-card) payment method is available by default. The following payment methods are connected on demand:

* [Card and QIWI Wallet payment token](#merchant-token-pay).
* [Faster Payments System](#merchant-form-sbp).
* [Mobile phone account](#merchant-form-phone-account).

To create a payment, send the following data in API request [Payment](#payments):

* API access key;
* amount of payment;
* payment method;
* other information for payment creation.

## Bank Card {#merchant-form-card}

The payment protocol supports both a two-step payment with holding funds on the customer's card, and a one-step payment without the authentication of the customer.

### Payment creation {#merchant-form-hold}

To start payment with subsequent hold of funds on the customer card (two-step payment), send the following data in API  request [Payment](#payments):

* API access key;
* amount of the payment;
* payment method `CARD` and customer's card data;
* other data for the payment.

For the two-step payment, the [reimbursement](#reimburse) is formed only after the [order confirmation](#merchant-capture).

<a name="one-step"></a>

<aside class="notice">
By default, when holding funds, the service expects <a href="#merchant-capture">confirmation of the payment</a> within 72 hours. At the end of the term, the payment is self-confirmed. To increase or reduce the waiting period, or to set up a payment auto-reversal, contact <a href="mailto:payin@qiwi.com">QIWI Support</a>. The waiting period may not last more than 5 days.
</aside>

For payment without the customer's authentication (one-step payment), include in the API request [Invoice](#invoice_put) the `"flags":["SALE"]` parameter. If you do not pass this parameter, the unconditional holding of funds for the payment will be made.

  }
}
~~~

If bank requires 3DS authentication of the customer, proceed with additional authentication from the issuer. In this case, the payment request adds `requirements.threeDS` JSON-object with fields:

- `acsUrl` — 3-D Secure authentication server URL to redirect to the issuer's confirmation page;
- `pareq` — an encrypted 3-D Secure authentication request.

To get the `PaReS` result of authentication, make a POST query to the 3-D Secure authentication server URL with parameters:

- `TermUrl` — customer redirection URL after successful 3-D Secure authentication;
- `MD` — a unique transaction identifier;
- `PaReq` — the `pareq` value from the response to the payment request.

To maintain backward compatibility, using 3-D Secure 1.0 or 3-D Secure 2.0 does not affect your integration with the API.

The customer's information is passed to the card payment system. The issuer bank either grants permission to charge funds without authentication (frictionless flow) or decides whether to authenticate with a single-time password (challenge flow). After the authentication is passed, the customer is redirected to `TermUrl` URL with the encrypted result of the authentication in the `PaRes` parameter.

To complete the authentication of the customer, pass on the API request [Completing customer authentication](#payment_complete):

* unique RSP ID;
* payment number (`paymentId` option) from the response to the payment request;
* 3-D Secure verification value (`PaRes` value)

### Confirm payment {#merchant-capture}

Content-type: application/json

~~~

The capture step is required only for two-step payments with holding funds.

To confirm payment:

* Get `paymentId` of the payment:
  * From [notification](#payment-callback) after successful holding funds.
  * From the response to [Payment status](#payment_get) API request.
* Send API request [Confirm payment](#capture) with received `paymentId` value.

## Payment token {#merchant-token-pay}

  },
  "customer": {
        "account": "token324"
  }
}
~~~

The payment tokens are used for charging a customer balance without entering card details or QIWI Wallet number. By default, the use of payment tokens is disabled. Contact your manager in QIWI Support to enable that.

The issue of a payment token is described [in this section](#payment-token-issue).

<aside class="warning">
Customer will be able to make payment by payment token only on the site where payment token was issued.

To make the payment token valid on other sites, send a request to <a href="mailto:payin@qiwi.com">QIWI Support</a>.
</aside>

To pay for the customer order with its payment token, send in API request [Payment](#payments) the following data:

* the payment token in `paymentMethod` JSON-object,
* customer identifier for which the payment token was issued, in `customer.account` parameter.

Parameter|Type|Description
--------|---|--------
paymentMethod.type|String|Type of the operation. Only `TOKEN`
paymentMethod.paymentToken|String| Payment token string
customer.account|String|Unique ID of the customer in the RSP system for which the payment token was issued. **Without this parameter, you cannot pay with the payment token.**

Customer won't have to enter its card data and proceed with 3-D Secure authentication.

## Faster Payments System {#merchant-form-sbp}

**Payment protocol** supports charging funds from the customer by [Faster Payments System](https://sbp.nspk.ru/) (SBP). With SBP, payment can be made to commercial organizations, including QR-coded ones.

By default, SBP payment method is turned off. To use this method, contact your manager in QIWI Support.

### Receiving QR-code {#qr-sbp}

  },
  "status": {
    "value": "WAITING",
    "changedDateTime": "2020-12-11T11:09:49+03:00"
  }
}
~~~

In order for the customer to make a payment through the SBP, release the ЙR-code. To do this, in the API request [Payment](#payments) include the `SBP` payment method:

`"paymentMethod" : { "type": "SBP" }`

To add a payment description, use the `comment` field in the request. If the field in the request is empty, the customer's bank app will show the name of your service as registered in QIWI.

In the response to the request, the JSON object `requirements.sbp` contains the data of the QR-code:

* `image.content` — base64-encoded QR-code. After decryption, you get an image to show to the customer.
* `payload` — URL-based QR for customer redirection to its bank app.

The QR-code is active for 72 hours and is deactivated after the period ends.

    "status": {
        "value": "WAITING",
        "changedDateTime": "2020-12-11T11:09:49+03:00"
    }
}
~~~

After paying for the QR-code, the payment will go to the final status and a [notification](#payment-callback) will be sent.

Without waiting for notification, the status of the payment can be [requested through the API](#payment_get).

## Payment from mobile phone account {#merchant-form-phone-account}

Purchases from a mobile phone account occur without entering card data. After merchant initiates payment, customer receives SMS from their mobile network operator. SMS contains the information about corresponding purchase. Customer approves or rejects the payment by the response SMS.

By default, this payment method is turned off. To use this method, contact your manager in QIWI Support.

### How to send a payment {#merchant-form-mobile-payment}

> Payment example

~~~json
{
  "paymentMethod": {
    "type": "MOBILE_COMMERCE",
    "phone": "+79111111111"
  },
  "amount": {
    "value": 5900.00,
    "currency": "RUB"
  },
  "flags": [
    "SALE"
  ],
  "customer": {
    "account": "79111111111",
    "email": "test@qiwi.com",
    "phone": "79111111111"
  }
}
~~~

When sending payment, put into `paymentMethod` object in [Payment API request](#payments) the following data:

* `type` — always `MOBILE_COMMERCE`.
* `phone` — phone number, from which to make a payment. Number should be in international format with `+` sign.
